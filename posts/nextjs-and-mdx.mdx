### Requirements

We'll build our website with following tools

1. [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/) A _React_ Wrapper
2. [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) Plugin to writed .mdx files.

> Following code is just an example of writing code in Next.js

```jsx:components/HoverableLink.js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

const non_hover_color = '#ff2a6d';
const hover_color = '#05d9e8';

export default class HoverableLink extends Component {
	constructor(props) {
		super(props);
		this.state = { 
			text_color: non_hover_color,
		};
	}

	handle_mouse_enter() {
		this.setState((state) => ({ text_color: hover_color }))
	}

	handle_mouse_leave() {
		this.setState((state) => ({ text_color: non_hover_color }))
	}

	render() {
		return (
				<a style = {{ color: this.state.text_color,
											textDecoration: 'none',
											cursor: 'pointer',
											borderBottom: '1px dashed #05d9e8', }}
						target = '_blank' 
						onMouseEnter = {() => this.handle_mouse_enter()}
						onMouseLeave = {() => this.handle_mouse_leave()}
						{...this.props.link_props} />
				)
	}

}
```
